ACADIFY — Affordable Digital Campus Platform

ACADIFY is an EdTech ERP project aimed at making digital campus systems accessible and affordable for small schools. While many campus management tools exist today, most of them are expensive, complex, and designed for large institutions. As a result, smaller schools often continue using manual registers, paper logbooks, and scattered tools.

ACADIFY is built to solve this gap by focusing on simplicity, usability, and real classroom needs instead of unnecessary features.

The project is being developed publicly as a learning-by-building initiative and started as a hackathon MVP. Rather than trying to build everything at once, ACADIFY follows a focused, step-by-step approach to product development.

MVP Focus

The first version of ACADIFY concentrates on the two most essential features used daily in schools:

Attendance System

A smooth and simple digital attendance system that allows teachers to mark and manage student attendance easily, replacing traditional paper attendance registers.

Class Logbook

A digital class logbook where teachers can record what was taught in each class session, replacing physical teaching diaries and logbooks.

These two features were selected because almost every school already maintains:

one attendance register

one class logbook

ACADIFY digitizes these fundamentals first, before expanding into additional modules.

Purpose

The core goal of ACADIFY is to:

 - Make digital campus systems affordable for small schools

 - Reduce manual and repetitive administrative work

 - Improve classroom record-keeping

 - Build a practical and easy-to-adopt platform for schools across India

Current Status

 - MVP under active development

 - Domain secured: acadify.tech

 - Built as a solo project

Focused on clarity, usability, and real-world workflows

ACADIFY is still evolving, but this repository represents the foundation of a practical, student- and teacher-first digital campus platform.
